# Unmeasured confounding simulations

## Description

Unmeasured confounding is often raised as a source of potential bias when evaluating non- randomized study protocols but evaluating such concerns during their design remains challenging. We propose a flexible methodology based on individual level simulations that can allow researchers to characterize the bias arising from unmeasured confounding with a specified but modifiable structure during the study design. 

## About
Functions available here conduct _de novo_ individual-level simulations to mimic a safety study using an active comparator cohort study design. Researchers can vary all the simulation parameters to tailor to their study-specific requirements. The pdf file 'instructions' provides step by step instructions of how to use this package
